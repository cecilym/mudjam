#Cecily's Room Additions

#1.The Drawing Room
The walls are papered in an ornate pink and gold floral pattern. 
Rococo trimmings curl along the walls up towards the gently domed ceiling.
##Exits:  
Three large windows line the Southward wall, opening up to the Sporting Garden.
The West door opens to the Galley Hall Stairs.
The East door opens to the Boudoir. 

#2.The Boudoir
Smells like honey and vanilla. An ivory velvet chemise is draped over a musty fainting chair.
The carpet is rumpled down towards the floorboards. This room is not usually so empty. 
##Exits:
The East door opens to the Drawing Room
The North door opens to Penny's Room
The South door opens to the Marble Washroom

#3.The Sporting Garden
The lawn is haphazardly manicured. Snails crawl in the corners.
##Exits:
The North Door opens to the Galley Hall
